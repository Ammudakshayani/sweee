<h1> CONCLUSION :-</h1>
<h1>Out of 50 people surveyed by us 21 members consuming the junk food and 29 members are consuming nutritious food. However if we talk in terms of finance available and frequency of junk food consumption, we found that43% of people spent more then Rs.3000 in a month over junk foods as compared with nutritious food in case of which 57% of them spent money for nutritious food.

We conclude that based on our limited research, fast food does play a role in obesity in the hypothesis that if provided awareness about the harm of fast food is provided to the people, people will reduce fast food consumption are valid.
