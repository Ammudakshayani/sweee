                            <p class="card-text mt-3">Nutrients are the organic substances congregated inside the food and used by the body for the maintenance of life and growth.

                                We get nutrients needed for our body from the food we consume i.e. rich in nutrients, for the proper growth and functioning of body. In absence of nutritious food, various health problems and deficiency diseases collides in our bodies.
                                
                                Some of the common results occurred due to nutritional deficiencies are:

                            <h4 class="card-title mt-3">what are the desieases caused by the junk food</h4>
                            <p class="card-text mt-3">There are several diseases caused by junk food. Some of which are –

                                1. Atherosclerosis
                                Junk foods contain a large number of saturated fats and cholesterol. These substances get accumulated in the arteries and are a threat to arterial health. This narrows the space for blood flow, lowering the amount of oxygen that reaches the cells. When the artery walls get damaged, it causes bleeding and blood clots. This condition is called atherosclerosis and can lead to strokes and heart attacks.
                                
                                2. Hypertension
                                The salt used in the seasoning of junk foods has sodium. And excessive intake of sodium can lead to hypertension or high blood pressure. With high blood pressure comes the risk of atherosclerosis and heart diseases. Some junk foods with high sodium content are –
                                
                                Burgers
                                
                                Tacos
                                
                                French fries
                                
                                Hot fruit pies
                                
                                Fried shrimp
                                
                                3. Type 2 Diabetes
                                Overeating junk food can make an individual obese or overweight. These conditions can further lead to type 2 diabetes and decreased insulin resistance, eye damage, skin condition, slow healing, hearing impairment, sleep apnea and dementia.
                                
                                4. Cancer
                                Again, junk foods themselves might not cause cancer, but the conditions arising due to eating excessive junk foods precipitate cancer. People who are overweight or have obesity are prone to kidney, colon, gallbladder and several other types of cancer.

                            <p class="card-text mt-3"> Junk food is a term used to describe food that is high in calories, fat, salt and sugar, but low in nutrients and health benefits. Junk food can be appealing for its convenience, taste and affordability, but it can also have negative effects on the human body. According to various sources , some of the diseases caused by junk food include:

                                - Atherosclerosis: This is a condition where fatty deposits build up in the arteries, narrowing them and reducing blood flow. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems.
                                - Hypertension: This is a condition where the blood pressure is abnormally high, putting stress on the heart and blood vessels. This can also increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Junk food often contains high amounts of sodium, which can contribute to hypertension.
                                - Type 2 diabetes: This is a condition where the body cannot use insulin properly, resulting in high blood sugar levels. This can damage various organs and tissues, such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves and skin. Junk food can cause obesity or overweight, which are major risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
                                - Cancer: This is a group of diseases where abnormal cells grow and spread uncontrollably, invading and destroying normal tissues. Junk food can cause obesity or overweight, which are associated with increased risk of various cancers, such as kidney, colon, gallbladder and others.
                                
                                These are some of the diseases caused by junk food that can affect the quality and quantity of life. Therefore, it is important to limit the consumption of junk food and replace it with healthier alternatives, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and low-fat dairy products. Eating a balanced diet, along with regular physical activity and adequate hydration, can help prevent or manage these diseases and promote overall well-being.
